# Twitter Bots
### Testing and experimenting with the Twitter API
![chatbot illustration](/../master/twitter-bots.png?raw=true "chatbot repository decorative illustration")

There are two bots: `poll.py` and `stream.py`.
### `poll.py`
This bot polls the Twitter API for its followers. It will follow any follower and unfollow ex-followers.
It does not use a stream but instead runs the function for following and unfollowing in an infinite `while` loop, sleeping at the end of each iteration to avoid exceeding the API rate limit.

### `stream.py`
This bot uses a stream to receive tweets from matching tracked sources in a live feed. It will ignore tweets where the API user is the author and handle other tweets accordingly;
* Reply to a mention which is not also a reply.
* Retweet and like any non-mentions from tracked sources.

## Hosting and installation
The code is hosted and run on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), on two free dynos.

I strongly recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

If you want to run the bots with your own Twitter API credentials, you need to export/set environmental variables according to `config.py`.
Once you've done that, run each bot in a console with either `python -m poll` or `python -m stream`.

Deploying on Heroku is almost as simple as following the official [Python guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).
The `Procfile` differs, and dynos won't start automatically when the process type is not `web`.
To run the bots, you need to `scale` the dynos from 0 to 1. The free tier on Heroku gives you access to two free dynos.
Scale-up dynos via the Heroku CLI:
```
$ heroku ps
Free dyno hours quota remaining this month: 550h 0m (100%)
Free dyno usage for this app: 0h 0m (0%)
For more information on dyno sleeping and how to upgrade, see:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-sleeping

No dynos on â¬¢ magicandcode-bot
$ heroku ps:scale stream=1
Scaling dynos... done, now running stream at 1:Free
$ heroku ps:scale poll=1
Scaling dynos... done, now running poll at 1:Free
```

Scale down dynos (take one or both bots offline):
```
$ heroku ps:scale stream=0
Scaling dynos... done, now running stream at 0:Free
$ heroku ps:scale poll=0
Scaling dynos... done, now running poll at 0:Free
```

Note that the instructions are tested on the macOS Terminal only. To use Windows CMD or Powershell, check the [official documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).


## Dependencies
* [python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) - Twitter API wrapper
* [environs](https://pypi.org/project/environs/) - Environment variables parsing

I use `environs`, but you can replace it with `python-dotenv`, `os.getenv` or similar.
